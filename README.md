# What did I use?
Firstly, I must thank https://github.com/xavery/ 
I use so much your work. Thank You! @xavery

# Instalation 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/linux923344/rozklad-mpk.git
```
In the `start.sh` you must change varable `HTML` , because your schadule will be on the `your-page.pl/rozklad`.
For example if you change it for `test123` You will have `your-page.pl/test123`

Also you can change the varable `lines`. I added my favourites line like `KORN42 MURA42 OPL01 ORZE42 RKAP73 SOB42 UAMB01`.

# Starting script
If you want to start the script you can run
```sh
./start.sh
```
# Tree files after instalation
```sh
